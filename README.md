# Wireless Switching System Based On Voice Recognition

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

*Atmel Studio
*Sinprog
*Hardware Setup
*Andriod apk



### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
1)Wireless Switching.pdf consists of finalised report of this project. 
2)Wireless-Switching-System/Minro_project/Minro_project.c is the code for programmming AVR microcontroller.
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
1)Install Atmel Studio 
2)Install Sinaprog to program the microcontroller 
3)Make setup for required hardware prototype as mentioned in above .pdf file 
4)Use Speech Decoder.apk for Voice Recognisation
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
